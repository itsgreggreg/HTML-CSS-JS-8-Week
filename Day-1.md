## Step 3 - Common Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard Shortcuts generally involve holding one key down and tapping another key. Web developers use them all the time for convenience and to save time.

 - Go to your neocities dashboard: https://neocities.org/dashboard
   - You should already be there from the end of __Step 2__
- Open your website in a new tab
  - Near the top of the page is a red link to your website, it looks like __yoursite.neocities.org__
    - Click it
- Go back to your dashboard
- Hover your mouse over __index.html__ and click the __Edit__ button that appears.

### control + a = Select all
In side your index.html file is the standard place-holder html that neocities gives you so you can see how neocities works. We don't want it 'cos we're gonna do better! Here's how you get rid of it.

 - Click anywhere inside the editor.
 - Hold __control__ and tap a
 - Now all the text in the code editor should be highlighted.
 - Press the __delete__ or __backspace__ key on your keyboard to get rid of all of it.
 - Click __[ Save ]__ in the upper right corner.

### control + r = Refresh
 - Go to your webpage tab
 - Hold __control__ and tap __r__ on your keyboard
 - Your webpage should now be blank. Awesome!

### control + c = Copy
 - Open this lesson file in a new tab
 - Highligh the following HTML with your mouse
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
    Hello!
 </body>
</html>
~~~
 - Hold __control__ and tap __c__
 - Now the HTML is in your computer's clipboard
   - The clipboard is just a way to store 1 piece of information at a time so that you can transfer it somewhere else quickly and easily.

### control + v = Paste
 - Go back to your neocities editor for the index.html file
 - Click anywhere in the editor
 - Hold __control__ and tap __v__

### control + s = Save
- Hold __control__ and tap __s__
- You should see a notice that __Your site has been saved__
- Go to your website tab and refresh!
  - It should now just say `Hello!`
- This is a very common combination of actions for a web programmer. Copy, Paste, Save, Refresh - We are going to be doing it all the time!
